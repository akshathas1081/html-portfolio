<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Let me tell about myself.So My name is Akshatha and I'm 19 years youngðŸ˜‰.I live with my parents(never been away from them).
  I dont have any siblings.I know it may sound good for one those who have siblings but trust me,its boring.
  I'm doing my Engineering in Computer Science at Sir M Visvesvariah Institute of Technology,Bangalore.I just finished my 3rd sem exams.
  Currently I'm about to enter my 4th sem.
</p>

<p>I'm very limited when it comes to getting attached to people.Idk whether it is good or bad.I do have a bunch of amazing friends with whom I love spending my time.
  I'm pretty happy with my friends.I'm actually a ambivert.I'm neither silent nor chatty.It totally depends on people around,my mood and many more factors.

<p>What I dont like about myself is I'm too lazy.I tend to postpone things very often.
 I cant be very open with anyone.I do share things with my close ones but not everything.
</p>I've always been good at studies.I love watching movies (or series). I'm not a reader.That's all for now.Byeeee</p>
